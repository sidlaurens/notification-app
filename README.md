# notification-app
Allows ticket notifications to Zendesk agents in the Zendesk home page. Notifications pertain only to those tickets the agent is assigned to.

### The following notifications are displayed to an agent in the Support group:

* An agent is assigned a new ticket.
* An agent's ticket is updated with a new comment
* An agent's ticket that was marked as solved has been re-opened.
* An agent's unsolved ticket has not been updated after 10 business hours.
